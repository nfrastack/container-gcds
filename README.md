# nfrastack/container-gcds

## About

This will build a container for Google Cloud Directory Sync. A tool to synchronize user and group data from your local LDAP directory to Google Workspace.

* Executes synchronization routines on a scheduled basis
* Error detection with customizable notification endpoints
* Sends statistics to Zabbix Server

This image needs manual configuration to get started. You will need to manually create the configuration file on another system with the `config-manager` GCDS GUI before the scheduler will occur. You will also need to import an OAUTH Token into that configuration file that was generated from another machine as of GCDS 5.x versions.

## Installation

### Prebuilt Images
Feature limited builds of the image are available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-gcds/pkgs/container/container-gcds) and [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/nfrastack/gcds).

To unlock advanced features, one must provide a code to be able to change specific environment variables from defaults. Support the development to gain access to a code.

To get access to the image use your container orchestrator to pull from the following locations:

```
ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-gcds:(image_tag)
docker.io/nfrastack/gcds:(image_tag)
```

Image tag syntax is:

`<image>:<optional tag>-<optional_distribution>_<optional_distribution_variant>`

Example:

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-gcds:latest` or

`ghcr.io/nfrastack/container-gcds:1.0`

* `latest` will be the most recent commit
* An optional `tag` may exist that matches the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) - These are the safest
* If it is built for multiple distributions there may exist a value of `alpine` or `debian`
* If there are multiple distribution variations it may include a version - see the registry for availability

Have a look at the container registries and see what tags are available.

#### Multi-Architecture Support

Images are built for `amd64` by default, with optional support for `arm64` and other architectures.

### Quick Start

* The quickest way to get started is using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). See the examples folder for a working [compose.yml](examples/compose.yml) that can be modified for your use.

* Map [persistent storage](#persistent-storage) for access to configuration and data files for backup.
* Set various [environment variables](#environment-variables) to understand the capabilities of this image.

### Persistent Storage

The following directories are used for configuration and can be mapped for persistent storage.

| Directory  | Description                                                                                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/config/` | Map this directory and place your GCDS .xml file here. State information is also stored here for encryption. |
| `/logs/`   | GCDS Log Output Directory                                                                                    |

### Environment Variables

#### Base Images used

This image relies on a customized base image in order to work.
Be sure to view the following repositories to understand all the customizable options:

| Image                                                   | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [OS Base](https://github.com/nfrastack/container-base/) | Base Image  |

Below is the complete list of available options that can be used to customize your installation.

* Variables showing an 'x' under the `Advanced` column can only be set if the containers advanced functionality is enabled.
